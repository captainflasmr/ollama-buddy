* Overview

A friendly Emacs interface for interacting with Ollama models. This package provides a convenient way to integrate Ollama's local LLM capabilities directly into your Emacs workflow with little or no configuration required.

The name is just something a little bit fun and it seems to always remind me of the "bathroom buddy" from the film Gremlins (although hopefully this will work better than that seemed to!)

* Whats New

** <2025-03-18> *0.9.6*

- Added a transient menu containing all commands currently presented in the chat buffer
- Added fabric prompting support, see https://github.com/danielmiessler/fabric
- Moved the presets to the top level so they will be present in the package folder

Ollama Buddy now includes a transient-based menu system to improve usability and streamline interactions. Yes, I originally stated that I would never do it, but I think it compliments my crafted simple textual menu and the fact that I have now defaulted the main chat interface to a simple menu.

This can give the user more options for configuration, they can use the chat in advanced mode where the keybindings are presented in situ, or a more minimal basic setup where the transient menu can be activated.  For my use-package definition I current have the following set up, with the two styles of menus sitting alongside each other :

  #+begin_src elisp
  :bind
  ("C-c o" . ollama-buddy-menu)
  ("C-c O" . ollama-buddy-transient-menu)
  #+end_src

The new menu provides an organized interface for accessing the assistant’s core functions, including chat, model management, roles, and Fabric patterns. This post provides an overview of the features available in the Ollama Buddy transient menus.

Yes that's right also =fabric= patterns!, I have decided to add in auto syncing of the patterns directory in https://github.com/danielmiessler/fabric

Simply I pull the patterns directory which contain prompt guidance for a range of different topics and then push them through a completing read to set the =ollama-buddy= system prompt, so a special set of curated prompts can now be applied right in the =ollama-buddy= chat!

Anyways, here is a description of the transient menu system.

*** What is the Transient Menu?

The transient menu in Ollama Buddy leverages Emacs' =transient.el= package (the same technology behind Magit's popular interface) to create a hierarchical, discoverable menu system. This approach transforms the user experience from memorizing numerous keybindings to navigating through logical groups of commands with clear descriptions.

*** Accessing the Menu

The main transient menu can be accessed with the keybinding =C-c O= when in an Ollama Buddy chat buffer. You can also call it via =M-x ollama-buddy-transient-menu= from anywhere in Emacs.

*** What the Menu Looks Like

When called, the main transient menu appears at the bottom of your Emacs frame, organized into logical sections with descriptive prefixes. Here's what you'll see:

#+begin_src

*** Direct Keybindings

For experienced users who prefer direct keybindings, all transient menu functions can also be accessed through keybindings with the prefix of your choice (or =C-c O= when in the chat minibuffer) followed by the key shown in the menu. For example:

- =C-c O s= - Set system prompt
- =C-c O m= - Switch model
- =C-c O P= - Open parameter menu

*** Customization

The transient menu can be customized by modifying the =transient-define-prefix= definitions in the package. You can add, remove, or rearrange commands to suit your workflow.

* Core Features in Detail

** Chat Interface

The ollama-buddy chat buffer is powered by =org-mode=, providing enhanced readability and structure. Conversations automatically format user prompts and AI responses with org-mode headings, making them easier to navigate and utilize.

Benefits include:
- Outlining and heading navigation
- Org export capabilities
- Source code fontification

Toggle Markdown to Org conversion with =C-c C-o=.

** Interface Levels

You can choose between two interface levels depending on your preference:

- *Basic Interface*: Shows minimal commands for new users
- *Advanced Interface*: Shows all available commands and features

Set your preferred interface level:

#+begin_src elisp
(setq ollama-buddy-interface-level 'basic)  ; or 'advanced
#+end_src

By default, the menu is set to Basic. Switch between levels during your session with =C-c A=.

** Conversation History

Ollama Buddy maintains context between your interactions by:

- Tracking conversation history between prompts and responses
- Sending previous messages to Ollama for improved contextual responses
- Displaying a history counter in the status line showing conversation length
- Providing configurable history length limits to control memory usage

Control this feature with:

#+begin_src elisp
;; Enable/disable conversation history (default: t)
(setq ollama-buddy-history-enabled t)

;; Set maximum conversation pairs to remember (default: 10)
(setq ollama-buddy-max-history-length 10)

;; Show/hide the history counter in the header line (default: t)
(setq ollama-buddy-show-history-indicator t)
#+end_src

History-related commands:
- =C-c H=: Toggle history tracking on/off
- =C-c X=: Clear the current conversation history
- =C-c V=: View the full conversation history in a dedicated buffer
- =C-c E=: Edit conversation history (universal argument to edit specific model)

** Parameter Management

Comprehensive parameter management gives you complete control over your Ollama model's behavior through API options:

- *All Parameters* - Set any custom option for the Ollama LLM at runtime
- *Smart Parameter Management*: Only modified parameters are sent to Ollama, preserving defaults
- *Visual Parameter Interface*: Clear display showing which parameters are active with highlighting

Access parameter management through keyboard shortcuts:
- =C-c P= - Edit a parameter
- =C-c G= - Display current parameters
- =C-c I= - Show parameter help
- =C-c K= - Reset parameters to defaults

** Command-Specific Parameters

You can define specific parameter sets for each command in the menu, enabling optimization for particular use cases:

#+begin_src elisp
;; Update properties and parameters at once
(ollama-buddy-update-command-with-params 'describe-code
 :model "codellama:latest"
 :parameters '((temperature . 0.3) (top_p . 0.8)))
#+end_src

This feature is particularly useful for:
1. *Code-related tasks*: Lower temperature for more deterministic code generation
2. *Creative writing*: Higher temperature for more varied and creative outputs
3. *Technical explanations*: Balanced settings for clear, accurate explanations
4. *Summarization tasks*: Custom parameters to control verbosity and focus

** System Prompt Support

Ollama Buddy supports system prompts, allowing you to set and manage system-level instructions for your AI interactions:

- *Set a system prompt*: Use =C-u C-c C-c= to designate any user prompt as a system prompt
- *Clear system prompt*: Use =C-u C-u C-c C-c= to clear the system prompt
- *View system prompt*: Use =C-c C-s= to display the current system prompt

System prompts remain active across user queries, providing better control over conversation context. The status bar displays an "S" indicator when a system prompt is active.

You can also define system prompts per command:

#+begin_src elisp
(ollama-buddy-update-menu-entry
 'refactor-code
 :model "qwen2.5-coder:7b"
 :system "You are an expert software engineer who improves code and only mainly using the principles exhibited by Ada")
#+end_src

** Token Usage Tracking

Real-time token tracking helps you monitor usage and performance:

- Track token counts, rates, and usage history
- Display token usage statistics (=C-c t= or menu option)
- Toggle token stats display after responses
- Real-time updates via timer

** Multi-model Comparison

With the multishot mode, you can send a prompt to multiple models in sequence and compare their responses:

- Models are assigned letters for quick selection (e.g., =(a) mistral=, =(b) gemini=)
- Use =C-c l= to initiate a multishot sequence
- Responses are stored in registers named after the assigned letters
- Status updates track progress during multishot execution

To use multishot mode:
1. =C-c l= to start a multishot session
2. Type a sequence of model letters (e.g., =abc= to use models a, b, and c)
3. The selected models process the prompt one by one
4. Responses are saved to registers for later recall

** Role-Based Presets

Roles in Ollama Buddy are essentially profiles tailored to specific tasks:

- Store custom roles in =ollama-buddy-roles-directory= (default: =~/.emacs.d/ollama-buddy-presets/=)
- Switch between roles with =M-x ollama-buddy-roles-switch-role= or menu option =R=
- Create custom roles with =M-x ollama-buddy-role-creator-create-new-role= or menu option =N=
- Open role directory with =M-x ollama-buddy-roles-open-directory= or menu option =D=

Preconfigured presets available:
- ollama-buddy--preset__buffy.el
- ollama-buddy--preset__default.el
- ollama-buddy--preset__emacs.el
- ollama-buddy--preset__developer.el
- ollama-buddy--preset__janeway.el
- ollama-buddy--preset__translator.el
- ollama-buddy--preset__writer.el

** Session Management

Session management allows you to save conversations and restore them with relevant context:

- *Save session* with =ollama-buddy-sessions-save= or =C-c S=
- *Load session* with =ollama-buddy-sessions-load= or =C-c L=
- *List sessions* with =ollama-buddy-sessions-list= or =C-c Y=
- *Delete session* with =ollama-buddy-sessions-delete= or =C-c K=
- *New session* with =ollama-buddy-sessions-new= or =C-c E=

Sessions preserve model-specific chat history to prevent context contamination across different models.

** Prompt History Support

Prompts are integrated into the Emacs history mechanism and persist across sessions:

- Use =M-p= to navigate prompt history in the chat buffer
- Use =M-p= / =M-n= within the minibuffer to insert previous prompts

* Screenshots / Demos

#+begin_src elisp
(command-name
 :key ?k              ; Character for menu selection
 :description "desc"  ; Menu item description
 :model "model-name"  ; Specific Ollama model (optional)
 :prompt "prompt"     ; System prompt (optional)
 :system "system"     ; System prompt (optional)
 :parameters ((param . value)) ; Command-specific parameters (optional)
 :action function)    ; Command implementation
#+end_src

** Examples

*** Adding New Commands

You can add new commands to =ollama-buddy-command-definitions= in your config:

#+begin_src elisp
;; Add a single new command
(add-to-list 'ollama-buddy-command-definitions
               '(pirate
                 :key ?i
                 :description "R Matey!"
                 :model "mistral:latest"
                 :prompt "Translate the following as if I was a pirate:"
                 :action (lambda () (ollama-buddy--send-with-command 'pirate))))

;; Incorporate into a use-package
(use-package ollama-buddy
  :load-path "path/to/ollama-buddy"
  :bind ("C-c o" . ollama-buddy-menu)
  (add-to-list 'ollama-buddy-command-definitions
               '(pirate
                 :key ?i
                 :description "R Matey!"
                 :model "mistral:latest"
                 :prompt "Translate the following as if I was a pirate:"
                 :action (lambda () (ollama-buddy--send-with-command 'pirate))))
  :custom ollama-buddy-default-model "llama:latest")

;; Add multiple commands at once
(setq ollama-buddy-command-definitions
      (append ollama-buddy-command-definitions
              '((summarize
                 :key ?u
                 :description "Summarize text"
                 :model "tinyllama:latest"
                 :prompt "Provide a brief summary:"
                 :action (lambda () 
                          (ollama-buddy--send-with-command 'summarize)))
                (translate-spanish
                 :key ?t
                 :description "Translate to Spanish"
                 :model "mistral:latest"
                 :prompt "Translate this text to Spanish:"
                 :action (lambda () 
                          (ollama-buddy--send-with-command 'translate-spanish))))))
#+end_src

*** Creating a Minimal Setup

You can create a minimal configuration by defining only the commands you need:

#+begin_src elisp
;; Minimal setup with just essential commands
(setq ollama-buddy-command-definitions
      '((send-basic
         :key ?l
         :description "Send Basic Region"
         :action (lambda () (ollama-buddy--send-with-command 'send-basic)))

        (quick-define
         :key ?d
         :description "Define word"
         :model "tinyllama:latest"
         :prompt "Define this word:"
         :action (lambda () 
                  (ollama-buddy--send-with-command 'quick-define)))
        (quit
         :key ?q
         :description "Quit"
         :model nil
         :action (lambda () 
                  (message "Quit Ollama Shell menu.")))))
#+end_src

** Tips for Custom Commands

1. Choose unique keys for menu items
2. Match models to task complexity (small models for quick tasks)
3. Use clear, descriptive names

** Command Properties Reference

| Property     | Description                              | Required |
|--------------+------------------------------------------+----------|
| :key         | Single character for menu selection      | Yes      |
| :description | Menu item description                    | Yes      |
| :model       | Specific Ollama model to use             | No       |
| :prompt      | Static system prompt                     | No       |
| :system      | System-level instruction                 | No       |
| :parameters  | Command-specific parameters              | No       |
| :action      | Function implementing the command        | Yes      |

- Model Selection and Fallback Logic

** Overview

You can associate specific commands defined in the menu with an Ollama LLM to optimize performance for different tasks. For example, if speed is a priority over accuracy, such as when retrieving synonyms, you might use a lightweight model like TinyLlama or a 1B–3B model. On the other hand, for tasks that require higher precision, like code refactoring, a more capable model such as Qwen-Coder 7B can be assigned to the "refactor" command on the buddy menu system.

Since this package enables seamless model switching through Ollama, the buddy menu can present a list of commands, each linked to an appropriate model. All Ollama interactions share the same chat buffer, ensuring that menu selections remain consistent. Additionally, the status bar on the header line and the prompt itself indicate the currently active model.

Ollama Buddy also includes a model selection mechanism with a fallback system to ensure commands execute smoothly, even if the preferred model is unavailable.

** Command-Specific Models

Commands in =ollama-buddy-command-definitions= can specify preferred models using the =:model= property. This allows optimizing different commands for specific models:

#+begin_src elisp
(defcustom ollama-buddy-command-definitions
  '((refactor-code
     :key ?r
     :description "Refactor code"
     :model "qwen-coder:latest"
     :prompt "refactor the following code:")
    (git-commit
     :key ?g
     :description "Git commit message"
     :model "tinyllama:latest"
     :prompt "write a concise git commit message for the following:")
    (send-region
     :key ?l
     :description "Send region"
     :model "llama:latest"))
  ...)
#+end_src

When =:model= is =nil=, the command will use whatever model is currently set as =ollama-buddy-default-model=.

** Fallback Chain

When executing a command, the model selection follows this fallback chain:

1. Command-specific model (=:model= property)
2. Current model (=ollama-buddy-default-model=)
3. User selection from available models

** Configuration Options

*** Setting the Fallback Model

#+begin_src elisp
(setq ollama-buddy-default-model "llama:latest")
#+end_src

** User Interface Feedback

When a fallback occurs, Ollama Buddy provides clear feedback:

- The header line shows which model is being used
- If using a fallback model, an orange warning appears showing both the requested and actual model
- The model status can be viewed using the "View model status" command (v key)

* AI assistant

A simple text information screen will be presented on the first opening of the chat, or when requested through the menu system, its just a bit of fun, but I wanted a quick start tutorial/assistant type of feel.

* Design ethos expanded / why create this package?

The Ollama Emacs package ecosystem is still emerging. Although there are some great implementations available, they tend to be LLM jack-of-all-trades, catering to various types of LLM integrations, including, of course, the major online offerings.

Recently, I have been experimenting with a local solution using =ollama=. While using =ollama= through the terminal interface with =readline= naturally leans toward Emacs keybindings, there are a few limitations:

- Copy and paste do not use Emacs keybindings like readline navigation. This is due to the way key codes work in terminals, meaning that copying and pasting into Emacs would require using the mouse!
- Searching through a terminal with something like Emacs =isearch= can vary depending on the terminal.
- Workflow disruption occur when copying and pasting between Emacs and =ollama=.
- There is no easy way to save a session.
- It is not using Emacs!

I guess you can see where this is going. The question is: how do I integrate a basic query-response mechanism to =ollama= into Emacs? This is where existing LLM Emacs packages come in, however, I have always found them to be more geared towards online models with some packages offering experimental implementations of =ollama= integration. In my case, I often work on an air-gapped system where downloading or transferring packages is not straightforward. In such an environment, my only option for LLM interaction is =ollama= anyway. Given the limitations mentioned earlier of interacting with =ollama= through a terminal, why not create a dedicated =ollama= Emacs package that is very simple to set up, very lightweight and leverages Emacs's editing capabilities to provide a basic query response interface to =ollama=?

I have found that setting up =ollama= within the current crop of LLM Emacs packages can be quite involved. I often struggle with the setup, I get there in the end, but it feels like there's always a long list of payloads, backends, etc., to configure. But what if I just want to integrate Emacs with =ollama=? It has a RESTful interface, so could I create a package with minimal setup, allowing users to define a default model in their init file (or select one each time if they prefer)?  It could also query the current set of loaded models through the =ollama= interface and provide a =completing-read= type of model selection, with potentially no model configuration needed!

Beyond just being lightweight and easy to configure, I also have another idea: a flexible menu system. For a while, I have been using a simple menu-based interface inspired by transient menus. However, I have chosen not to use =transient= because I want this package to be compatible with older Emacs versions. Additionally, I haven’t found a compelling use case for a complex transient menu and I prefer a simple, opaque top level menu.

To achieve this, I have decided to create a flexible =defcustom= menu system. Initially, it will be configured for some common actions, but users can easily modify it through the Emacs customization interface by updating a simple alist.

For example, to refactor code through an LLM, a prepended text string of something like "Refactor the following code:" is usually applied. To proofread text, "Proofread the following:" could be prepended to the body of the query. So, why not create a flexible menu where users can easily add their own commands? For instance, if someone wanted a command to uppercase some text (even though Emacs can already do this), they could simply add the following entry to the =ollama-buddy-menu-items= alist:

#+begin_src elisp
(?u . ("Upcase" 
       (lambda () (ollama-buddy--send "convert the following to uppercase:"))))
#+end_src

Then the menu would present a menu item "Upcase" with a "u" selection, upcasing the selected region.  You could go nuts with this, and in order to double down on the autogeneration of a menu concept, I have provided a =defcustom= =ollama-buddy-menu-columns= variable so you can flatten out your auto-generated menu as much as you like!

This is getting rambly, but another key design consideration is how prompts should be handled and in fact how do I go about sending text from within Emacs?. Many implementations rely on a chat buffer as the single focal point, which seems natural to me, so I will follow a similar approach.

I've seen different ways of defining a prompt submission mechanism, some using <RET>, others using a dedicated keybinding like C-c <RET>, so, how should I define my prompting mechanism? I have a feeling this could get complicated, so lets use the KISS principle, also, how should text be sent from within Emacs buffers? My solution? simply mark the text and send it, not just from any Emacs buffer, but also within the chat window. It may seem slightly awkward at first (especially in the chat buffer, where you will have to create your prompt and then mark it), but it provides a clear delineation of text and ensures a consistent interface across Emacs. For example, using M-h to mark an element requires minimal effort and greatly simplifies the package implementation. This approach also allows users to use the **scratch** buffer for sending requests if so desired!

Many current implementations create a chat buffer with modes for local keybindings and other features. I have decided not to do this and instead, I will provide a simple editable buffer (ASCII text only) where all =ollama= interactions will reside. Users will be able to do anything in that buffer; there will be no bespoke Ollama/LLM functionality involved. It will simply be based on a =special= buffer and to save a session?, just use =save-buffer= to write it to a file, Emacs to the rescue again!

Regarding the minimal setup philosophy of this package, I also want to include a fun AI assistant-style experience. Nothing complicated, just a bit of logic to display welcome text, show the current =ollama= status, and list available models. The idea is that users should be able to jump in immediately. If they know how to install/start =ollama=, they can install the package without any configuration, run `M-x ollama-buddy-menu`, and open the chat. At that point, the "AI assistant" will display the current =ollama= status and provide a simple tutorial to help them get started.

The backend?, well I initially decided simply to use =curl= to stimulate the =ollama= RESTful API but after getting that to work I thought it might be best to completely remove that dependency, so now I am using a native network solution using =make-network-process=.  Yes it is a bit overkill, but it works, and ultimately gives me all the flexibility I could every want without having to depend on an external tool.

I have other thoughts regarding the use of local LLMs versus online AI behemoths. The more I use =ollama= with Emacs through this package, the more I realize the potential of smaller, local LLMs. This package allows for quick switching between these models while maintaining a decent level of performance on a regular home computer. I could, for instance, load up =qwen-coder= for code-related queries (I have found the 7B Q4/5 versions to work particularly well) and switch to a more general model for other queries, such as =llama= or even =deepseek-r1=.

Phew! That turned into quite a ramble, maybe I should run this text through =ollama-buddy= for proofreading! :)

* Connection monitoring

Good ollama connection status visibility is maintained either by default using basic coding logic or if monitoring is desired then configure as thus:

By default, strategic status checks should be enough to indicate a good consistent ollama running state.

* Interactive functions

All interactive functions available in ollama-buddy are listed in the original README.

* Kanban

Here is a kanban of the features that I plan on (hopefully) adding in due course.
