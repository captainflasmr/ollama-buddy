* Ollama Buddy Testing Process/Strategy

This file contains a description of my testing strategy for the =ollama-buddy= Emacs package and the tests directory includes local unit tests and files to aid in robustly testing before pushing to =github= https://github.com/captainflasmr/ollama-buddy and then on to MELPA.

** Validate/lint elisp

- Run =checkdoc=
- =byte-compile= on ollama-buddy.el
- =flycheck= on ollama-buddy.el
- =package-lint= on ollama-buddy.el
- Possibly =melpazoid= (if I can be bothered!)

** Batch-byte-compile

#+begin_src bash
#!/bin/bash

# List of elisp files to compile
elisp_files=(
  "ollama-buddy-awesome.el"
  "ollama-buddy-core.el"
  "ollama-buddy.el"
  "ollama-buddy-fabric.el"
  "ollama-buddy-openai.el"
  "ollama-buddy-claude.el"
  "ollama-buddy-gemini.el"
  "ollama-buddy-grok.el"
  "ollama-buddy-transient.el"
)

# Directory above current one
elisp_dir="$( cd "$( dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}" )/.." && pwd )"

for el in "${elisp_files[@]}"; do
  emacs -Q --batch \
    --eval "(add-to-list 'load-path \"$elisp_dir\")" \
    -f batch-byte-compile "$elisp_dir/$el"
done
#+end_src

** Run ollama-buddy with different Emacs versions

- [X] emacs-28.1
- [X] emacs-29.3
- [X] emacs-29.4
- [X] emacs-30.1

Using the following script to generate a very simple init.el file which is then run up against varying versions of Emacs to then run up =ollama-buddy= using =C-c o= and perform some quick tests.

#+begin_src bash
#!/bin/bash

# Script to test ollama-buddy package in a vanilla Emacs environment
# Usage: ./test-ollama-buddy.sh [emacs-version]
# Example: ./test-ollama-buddy.sh 29.3

# Default Emacs version if none specified
VERSION=${1:-"28.2"}
PACKAGE_PATH="~/source/repos/ollama-buddy"

# Create a temporary directory for the test
TEMP_DIR=$(mktemp -d -t ollama-buddy-test-XXXXXX)
INIT_FILE="$TEMP_DIR/init.el"

# Create a minimal init.el file
cat > "$INIT_FILE" << EOF
;; Minimal init.el for testing ollama-buddy (offline version)

;; Add the package to the load path
(add-to-list 'load-path "$PACKAGE_PATH")

;; Load the package
(require 'ollama-buddy)
(require 'ollama-buddy-transient)

;; Add the key binding
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c o") 'ollama-buddy-menu)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c O") 'ollama-buddy-transient-menu-wrapper)

;; Show a message to confirm we're in test mode
(message "Testing ollama-buddy in vanilla Emacs %s" emacs-version)
EOF

# Run Emacs with the temporary init file
echo "Starting Emacs $VERSION with minimal configuration..."
echo "Testing ollama-buddy from: $PACKAGE_PATH"
echo "Temporary init file: $INIT_FILE"

# Run the appropriate Emacs version
"$HOME/bin/emacs-$VERSION" -Q -l "$INIT_FILE"

# Cleanup
echo "Cleaning up temporary directory..."
rm -rf "$TEMP_DIR"
#+end_src

** Prompt Text Edge Cases

Sending weird characters in the file =prompt-edge-text-cases.txt= with various edge cases and challenging content to test =ollama-buddy= text handling capabilities.

This test text src includes:

- Various Unicode and special characters
- Different types of quotation marks
- Mixed programming syntax
- Emojis and complex Unicode symbols
- Different line endings
- Shell commands with special characters
- SQL queries with mixed quotes
- URLs and file paths
- Mixed language content
- JSON-like structures

** Prompting

*** Logic & Reasoning

If all bloops are razzles, and all razzles are lazzles, are all bloops lazzles?

Which is heavier: a ton of feathers or a ton of bricks?

A bat and ball cost $1.10. The bat costs $1 more than the ball. How much does the ball cost?

*** Common Sense

What happens when you put ice cubes in warm water?

Can you fold a piece of paper in half more than 7 times?

Why do we use umbrellas?

*** Pattern Recognition

What comes next: 2, 4, 8, 16, ?

Complete the pattern: circle, triangle, circle, square, circle, ?

If APPLE = 65, what does DOG equal?

*** Language Understanding

"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" - what's special about this sentence?

Explain the joke: "Why don't scientists trust atoms? Because they make up everything!"

What's the difference between "their," "there," and "they're"?

*** Simple Mathematics

What's 17% of 200?

If a pizza has 8 slices and 3 people share it equally, how many slices does each person get?

Simplify: (3 + 5) Ã— 2 - 4

*** Creative Thinking

Write a 2-sentence horror story

Give me 3 unusual uses for a paperclip

If you were a color, what color would you be and why?

*** Bad Sentence

This aint a good sentence, pleez rewrite!

*** Temperature

This aint a good sentence, pleez rewrite!

Temperature 0.0:

Very pricise proofreading, typically only a single concise sentence.

Temperature to 2.0:

More casual, with a slangish alternative given.

*** History/context

History turned on:

What is the capital of the UK?

and of France

Now turn off History:

and of Germany

*** elisp structure to org-table

Given the following elisp data structure can you extract out an org table that contains the following columns : key : description : model

#+begin_src elisp
(setq ollama-buddy-command-definitions
      '(
        ;; General Commands
        (open-chat
         :key ?o
         :description "Open chat buffer"
         :action ollama-buddy--open-chat)
        
        (swap-model
         :key ?m
         :description "Swap model"
         :action ollama-buddy--swap-model)
        
        (send-region
         :key ?l
         :description "Send region"
         :action (lambda () (ollama-buddy--send-with-command 'send-region)))
        
        (describe-code
         :key ?c
         :description "Describe code"
         :model "qwen2.5-coder:3b"
         :prompt "describe the following code:"
         :action (lambda () (ollama-buddy--send-with-command 'describe-code)))
        
        (dictionary-lookup
         :key ?d
         :description "Dictionary Lookup"
         :model "llama3.2:1b"
         :prompt "For the following word provide a typical dictionary definition:"
         :action (lambda () (ollama-buddy--send-with-command 'dictionary-lookup)))
        
        (quit
         :key ?q
         :description "Quit"
         :action (lambda () (message "Quit Ollama Shell menu.")))
        )
      )
#+end_src

**** expected output

| Key | Description        | Model            |
|-----+--------------------+------------------|
| o   | Open chat buffer   |                  |
| m   | Swap model         |                  |
| l   | Send region        |                  |
| c   | Describe code      | qwen2.5-coder:3b |
| d   | Dictionary Lookup  | llama3.2:1b      |
| q   | Quit               |                  |
      
** Menu testing

Open up =leagues.txt=, select/mark any text, open up =ollama-buddy-menu= and test pushing given different prompting to the chat buffer.

** Run with test server (without ollama)

There is a test server written in python that can simulate many =ollama= responses so =ollama-buddy= can now be tested completely offline and of course the JSON explicitly inspected.

See =server.py= and run with:

~python3 ./server.py~
