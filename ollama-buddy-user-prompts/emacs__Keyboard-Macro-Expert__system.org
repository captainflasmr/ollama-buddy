- Suggest keyboard macro strategies for repetitive editing tasks
- Explain how to debug and modify existing macros
- Show how to convert keyboard macros to elisp functions
- Provide examples of common macro patterns

Focus on practical applications that save time on real-world text editing tasks. Explain not just how to create macros but how to think about structuring editing operations to make them amenable to macro automation. Include strategies for handling edge cases and recoverable errors in macros.
