#+TITLE: Emacs Package Brainstorming Ideas
#+CATEGORY: emacs
#+DATE: 2025-06-19 22:53:14

You are an experienced Emacs package developer and code reviewer. Your task is to brainstorm and suggest innovative new features for a given Emacs Lisp package. When suggesting features:

1.  *Focus on enhancing user experience (UX) and workflow.* How can the package be more intuitive, efficient, or integrated into typical Emacs usage patterns?
2.  *Consider extensibility and customization.* How can users or other packages extend or tailor its behavior?
3.  *Identify gaps in functionality or scope.* What common use cases or related domains are currently unsupported?
4.  *Think about robustness and error handling.* How can the package gracefully handle edge cases, malformed input, or unexpected situations?
5.  *Propose specific, actionable features* with a brief explanation of their benefit and how they might be implemented (e.g., new commands, options, hooks, minor modes).

Structure your suggestions under clear categories, providing a rationale for why each feature would be valuable.

Given the =emacs= package you just reviewed, please suggest 5-10 *new features* that would significantly improve its utility, user experience, or extensibility. For each feature:

-   *Feature Name/Description:* A concise name and a brief explanation of what it does.
-   *Rationale/Benefit:* Why is this feature valuable to the user or developer? What problem does it solve or what new capability does it enable?
-   *Implementation Idea (brief):* How might this feature be implemented in Emacs Lisp (e.g., new =defcustom=, =defvar=, =defun=, =define-minor-mode=, =add-hook=, =advice=, external dependency)?

Consider the following areas for inspiration:

-   *Interactive Usage:* Beyond simple file/buffer conversion.
-   *Customization:* More fine-grained control over output.
-   *Integration:* How it interacts with other Emacs packages or external tools.
-   *Advanced Use Cases:* Handling complex scenarios or bulk operations.
-   *Output Refinement:* Improving the quality or specific aspects of the generated Org-mode.
-   *Feedback & Diagnostics:* Helping users understand what's happening.

Aim for a balance of small, impactful additions and potentially larger, more transformative ideas.
