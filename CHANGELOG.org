** <2026-01-31 Fri> *1.1.6*

Removed model status buffer

- Removed =ollama-buddy-show-model-status= function and =*Ollama Model Status*= buffer
- Removed =C-c v= keybinding and transient menu entry
- Model information is available in the model management buffer (=C-c W=)

** <2026-01-31 Fri> *1.1.5*

Added global system prompt for consistent response formatting

- Added =ollama-buddy-global-system-prompt= customization with sensible default instructing models to avoid markdown tables and use plain prose
- Added =ollama-buddy-global-system-prompt-enabled= toggle (default: t) to enable/disable the global prompt

- Added toggle to transient menu under "Display Toggle" (key: 9)
- Works with all providers: Ollama, OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, Grok, and Codestral

This feature helps ensure consistent response formatting across different models, avoiding issues like unexpected markdown tables in responses.

Consolidated model management

- Moved "Recommended Models (Pull)" section into =C-c W= model management buffer
- Removed =C-c A= (Detailed Info) keybinding and =ollama-buddy-show-interface-info= function

Header-line and keybinding improvements

- Added =C-c RET= keybinding to send prompts (matches gptel convention)
- Simplified header-line: removed backend indicator (N/C)
- Changed header-line "Markdown" indicator to "MD" for compactness
- Fixed markdown to org heading conversion: MD headings now offset by 2 levels so H1 becomes org level 3, properly nesting under the =** [MODEL] RESPONSE= heading

Improved chat UX and simplified codebase

- Added =ollama-buddy-auto-scroll= customization option (default: nil)

- Removed =ollama-buddy-highlight-models-enabled=, =ollama-buddy-toggle-model-highlighting=
- Simplifies codebase and may improve org-mode buffer performance

** <2026-01-30 Thu> *1.1.2*

Simplified chat interface

- Streamlined welcome screen showing only essential commands
- Full interface info (models, commands) moved to separate =*Ollama Buddy Info*= buffer via =C-c A=
- Model selection now shows counts: =C-c m (10 ollama / 4 online)= and =C-u C-c m (7 cloud)=
- Header line displays bold prefix characters for loaded external providers: =acgks=
- Welcome screen lists enabled online LLM providers (e.g., "Online: a: OpenAI | c: Claude")

** <2026-01-28 Tue> *1.1*

Added Ollama Cloud Models support

- Cloud models (running on ollama.com infrastructure) now work seamlessly
- =ollama-buddy-cloud-signin= to automatically open browser for authentication
- Cloud models are proxied through the local Ollama server which handles authentication
- Use =C-u C-c m= or transient menu "Model > Cloud" to select cloud models
- Status line shows ☁ indicator when using a cloud model
- Available cloud models include: qwen3-coder:480b-cloud, deepseek-v3.1:671b-cloud, gpt-oss:120b-cloud, minimax-m2.1:cloud, and more

To use cloud models:
1. Sign in once with =M-x ollama-buddy-cloud-signin= (opens browser automatically)
2. Select a cloud model with =C-u C-c m=
3. Use normally - the local Ollama server handles cloud authentication

#+begin_src elisp
;; Cloud models work with no additional configuration
;; Just sign in once via the transient menu: Cloud Auth > Sign In
(use-package ollama-buddy
  :bind
  ("C-c o" . ollama-buddy-menu)
  ("C-c O" . ollama-buddy-transient-menu-wrapper))
#+end_src

- Color System Reworking
  - Removed all model color-related functions and variables

Fix model reference error exceeding 26 models #15

Update =ollama-buddy= to handle more than 26 models by using prefixed combinations for model references beyond 'z'. This prevents errors in =create-intro-message= when the local server hosts a large number of models.

** <2025-05-03> *0.9.42*

Added the following to recommended models:

- qwen3:0.6b
- qwen3:1.7b
- qwen3:4b
- qwen3:8b

and fixed pull model

** <2025-05-02> *0.9.41*

Refactored model prefixing again so that when using only ollama models no prefix is applied and is only applied when online LLMs are selected (for example claude, chatGPT e.t.c)

I think this makes more sense and is cleaner for I suspect the majority who may use this package are probably more interested in just using ollama models and the prefix will probably be a bit confusing.

This could be a bit of a breaking change once again I'm afraid for those ollama users that have switched and are now familiar with prefixing "o:", sorry!

** <2025-05-02> *0.9.40*

Added vision support for those ollama models that can support it!

** <2025-04-29> *0.9.38*

Added model unloading functionality to free system resources

- Add unload capability for individual models via the model management UI
- Create keyboard shortcut (C-c C-u) for quick unloading of all models
- Display running model count and unload buttons in model management buffer
  
** <2025-04-25> *0.9.37*

- Display modified parameters in token stats

** <2025-04-25> *0.9.36*

Added Reasoning/Thinking section visibility toggle functionality

** <2025-04-21> *0.9.35*

Added Grok support

** <2025-04-20> *0.9.33*

Fixed utf-8 encoding stream response issues from remote LLMs.

** <2025-04-19> *0.9.32*

Finished the remote LLM decoupling process, meaning that the core =ollama-buddy= logic is now not dependent on any remote LLM, and each remote LLM package is self-contained and functions as a unique extension.

** <2025-04-18> *0.9.31*

Refactored model prefixing logic and cleaned up

- Standardized model prefixing by introducing distinct prefixes for Ollama (=o:=), OpenAI (=a:=), Claude (=c:=), and Gemini (=g:=) models.
- Centralized functions to get full model names with prefixes across different model types.
- Removed redundant and unused variables related to model management.

Note that there may be some breaking changes here especially regarding session recall as all models will now have a prefix to uniquely identify their type.  For =ollama= recall, just edit the session files to prepend the ollama prefix of "o:"

** <2025-04-17> *0.9.30*

Added Gemini integration!

As with the Claude and ChatGPT integration, you will need to add something similar to them in your configuration. I currently have the following set up to enable access to the remote LLMs:

#+begin_src elisp
(use-package ollama-buddy
  :bind
  ("C-c o" . ollama-buddy-menu)
  ("C-c O" . ollama-buddy-transient-menu-wrapper)
  :custom
  (ollama-buddy-openai-api-key
   (auth-source-pick-first-password :host "ollama-buddy-openai" :user "apikey"))
  (ollama-buddy-claude-api-key
   (auth-source-pick-first-password :host "ollama-buddy-claude" :user "apikey"))
  (ollama-buddy-gemini-api-key
   (auth-source-pick-first-password :host "ollama-buddy-gemini" :user "apikey"))
  :config
  (require 'ollama-buddy-openai nil t)
  (require 'ollama-buddy-claude nil t)
  (require 'ollama-buddy-gemini nil t))
#+end_src

Also with the previous update all the latest model names will be pulled, so there should be a full comprehensive list for each of the main remote AI LLMs!
